An embedded system application that turns on the LED when you open your hand using ESP8266 and turns off the LED when you close your hand.
The model I use is a ready-trained model if esp8266
If you think of an application running on it, you should install an https server on esp8266.
In Microsoft Edge, the camera may not open and may give an error. It works better in Chrome.
